I would start by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Eytan Ruppin, who has been the chief advisor of my PhD. It has been a great fortune for me to join Eytan''s lab and work under his mentoring, from which I have benefited a lot. His enthusiasm for science and vision for the future of our field has been a constant inspiration that motivates me to keep learning new things and taking on new challenges. More importantly, I will always be indebted to his care and kind help to me that extends beyond academic life. \par

I would also like to thank my committee for being extremely supportive and helpful towards my study and research. In particular, I truly appreciate Dr. Sridhar Hannenhalli for his time and patience in having many discussions with me and providing invaluable guidance to my projects. I would like to thank Prof. Philip Johnson and Prof. Stephen Mount who kindly helped me out and joined my committee later in my studies, and Prof. Najib El-Sayed, Dr. Stefan Ambs, as well as Dr. Hector Bravo (my former committee member) for their guidance and responsiveness to my questions and requests. During my PhD I have had the honor to work with many other excellent senior scientists and PIs, including Dr. Alejandro Schaffer, Dr. Michael Gertz, Dr. Cenk Sahinalp, Dr. Nicholas Restifo, Dr. Ayelet Erez, Dr. Yardena Samuels, Dr. Ze''ev Ronai, Dr. Ani Deshpande, Dr. Sumit Chanda, Dr. Ariel Israel, Dr. Yuval Tabach, Dr. Chi-Ping Day, Dr. Max Leiserson, Dr. Yongmei Zhao, and many more. I have learned a lot from them about doing science and scientific collaboration, and I would like to thank them all. \par

Furthermore, I would like to thank all my lab mates and friends from NIH/CDSL, BISI/CBBG, CBCB and beyond. It is really hard to name all the people who have extended their kindness towards me and made my PhD journey a significantly better one, but I would like to mention a few including Dr. Kunal Kundu, Dr. Nathan Olson and Sushant Patkar. Additional special thanks to Sanju Sinha, Dr. Nishanth Ulhas Nair, Dr. Kun Wang, Dr. Joo Sang Lee, Dr. Madhusudhanan Sukumar, and Dr. Lipika R. Pal, whom I have worked closely with -- it has been a true pleasure to learn from them, many of whom have also helped me a lot in life beyond research. I want to thank Dr. Noam Auslander and Dr. Keren Yizhak for sharing codes and answering my questions on metabolic modeling, and Dr. Laura Riva for biological experimental work on one of my thesis projects. Besides I would like to thank the staff at UMD and NIH for their kind help, including Dr. Michelle Brooks, Gwen Warman, Dr. Zakiya Whatley, Barbara Lewis, Nadia Nimley, as well as the faculties Dr. Hadiya Woodham, Prof. Charles Delwiche and Prof. Eric Haag. \par

Last but not least, I thank my family and my wife Jiaqi for their unconditional love and support. Throughout my journey they have been with me sharing the same joy, and the same grief from loss. I would not have reached where I am without them.
