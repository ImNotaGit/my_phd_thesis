T lymphocytes are powerful immune cells that can destroy tumors, but cancers have developed tricks to evade killing. Vodnala et al. found that potassium ions in the tumor microenvironment serve a dual role of influencing T cell effector function and stemness (see the Perspective by Baixauli Celda et al.). Increased potassium impairs T cell metabolism and nutrient uptake, resulting in a starvation state known as autophagy. The increased potassium can also preserve T cells in a stem-like state where they retain the capacity to divide. These seemingly divergent processes are linked to the cellular distribution of acetyl–coenzyme A, which, when manipulated, can restore the ability of human T cells to eliminate tumors in mice.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONCancers persist and progress despite the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A paradox of tumor immunology is that tumor antigen–specific TILs are dysfunctional in situ and yet can mediate regression of large metastatic tumors after immune checkpoint blockade or adoptive cell transfer. TILs are predominantly considered “exhausted” because of chronic antigen exposure, but recent studies have revealed that T cells within tumors exist in a continuum of epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic states. A small subset of T cell clonotypes in TILs expressing the transcription factor TCF7 possess stem cell–like behaviors including self-renewal, multipotency, and persistence. Although these cells appear to be responsible for tumor destruction in the setting of successful immunotherapy, the mechanisms underlying their generation and maintenance are unknown.
RATIONALETo progress from a naïve, stem cell–like state after activation, T cells rely on the uptake and consumption of extracellular nutrients to enact robust aerobic glycolysis and mTOR-driven anabolic growth. In multiple organisms, the cellular response to starvation preserves stemness and enhances organismal longevity. Cellular necrosis is a feature of many solid tumors, and higher densities of necrosis are inversely correlated to patient survival. Necrotic cells release intracellular contents into the extracellular space. Because the intracellular concentration of potassium is higher than the extracellular compartment ({\textasciitilde}145 mM versus {\textasciitilde}5 mM), local potassium levels within the tumor interstitial space can exceed 40 mM. We hypothesized that elevated extracellular potassium found in tumor interstitial fluid would disrupt the electrochemical gradient that facilitates T cell nutrient uptake, simultaneously limiting the acquisition of effector programs and the coincident loss of stemness. In the present work, we sought to explore the impact of high levels of potassium found in tumors on T cell stemness and antitumor capacity.
RESULTSWe found that elevated extracellular potassium characteristic of the extracellular space within tumors reduced the uptake and consumption of local nutrients by antitumor T cells, inducing a state of functional caloric restriction. A starvation response ensued, resulting in autophagy, mitochondrially dominant metabolism, and a paucity of available cofactors obligatory for histone modification and the epigenetic remodeling required for progressive differentiation. Both nucleocytosolic acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) and methionine intermediates were depleted. Depletion of nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA limited the acquisition of histone acetylation on the promoters and enhancers of genes encoding effector molecules. Simultaneously, nutrient deprivation reduced methionine intermediates, depressing methylation of histone marks that normally suppress stemness-associated programs. Treatment of antitumor T cells with elevated extracellular potassium as well as pharmacologic or gene therapies mimicking mechanisms of functional starvation resulted in T cells with retained stemness, evidenced by self-renewal and multipotency, thereby enabling the enhanced destruction of large, established tumors.
CONCLUSIONThese data provide a link between tumor-induced immune suppression and the stem cell–like properties of some antitumor T cells. Moreover, these findings deepen our understanding of how cancer can progress despite the presence of T cells that continue to harbor the capacity for its destruction. Finally, we identify new therapeutic strategies to metabolically induce stemness programs in antitumor T cells that enhance cancer immunotherapies. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/content/sci/363/6434/eaau0135/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Modified “Waddington valley” depicting T cell differentiation and the role of potassium in preserving T cell stemness.Left: Physiologic conditions driving T cell differentiation after activation (blue) to engage anabolic metabolism for acquiring effector functions (red). Right: Starvation response resulting from elevated extracellular potassium (↑[K+]e, white snow in valleys) drives catabolic metabolism and maintains T cell stemness. Height of the valley defines T cell potential to differentiate; segments of the valley define duration to reach senescence or death.
A paradox of tumor immunology is that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are dysfunctional in situ, yet are capable of stem cell–like behavior including self-renewal, expansion, and multipotency, resulting in the eradication of large metastatic tumors. We find that the overabundance of potassium in the tumor microenvironment underlies this dichotomy, triggering suppression of T cell effector function while preserving stemness. High levels of extracellular potassium constrain T cell effector programs by limiting nutrient uptake, thereby inducing autophagy and reduction of histone acetylation at effector and exhaustion loci, which in turn produces CD8+ T cells with improved in vivo persistence, multipotency, and tumor clearance. This mechanistic knowledge advances our understanding of T cell dysfunction and may lead to novel approaches that enable the development of enhanced T cell strategies for cancer immunotherapy.

	abstract = {The response of the body to a cancer is not a unique mechanism but has many parallels with inflammation and wound healing. This article reviews the links between cancer and inflammation and discusses the implications of these links for cancer prevention and treatment. We suggest that the inflammatory cells and cytokines found in tumours are more likely to contribute to tumour growth, progression, and immunosuppression than they are to mount an effective host antitumour response. Moreover cancer susceptibility and severity may be associated with functional polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokine genes, and deletion or inhibition of inflammatory cytokines inhibits development of experimental cancer. If genetic damage is the “match that lights the fire” of cancer, some types of inflammation may provide the “fuel that feeds the flames”. Over the past ten years information about the cytokine and chemokine network has led to development of a range of cytokine/chemokine antagonists targeted at inflammatory and allergic diseases. The first of these to enter the clinic, tumour necrosis factor antagonists, have shown encouraging efficacy. In this article we have provided a rationale for the use of cytokine and chemokine blockade, and further investigation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in the chemoprevention and treatment of malignant diseases.},

However, subsequent observations that nude mice do not completely lack functional T cells6,7 and that two components of the immune system—IFNγ8,9 and perforin10,11,12—help to prevent tumour formation in mice have led to renewed interest in a tumour-suppressor role for the immune response. Here we show that lymphocytes and IFNγ collaborate to protect against development of carcinogen-induced sarcomas and spontaneous epithelial carcinomas and also to select for tumour cells with reduced immunogenicity. The immune response thus functions as an effective extrinsic tumour-suppressor system. However, this process also leads to the immunoselection of tumour cells that are more capable of surviving in an immunocompetent host, which explains the apparent paradox of tumour formation in immunologically intact individuals.},

When implanted in BALB/c mice, IFN gamma-insensitive Meth A cells displayed enhanced tumorigenicity compared with control Meth A cells and were not rejected when tumor-bearing mice were treated with concentrations of LPS that eliminated control tumors. In Meth A immune mice, IFN gamma-insensitive Meth A did not establish tumors while IFN gamma-insensitive tumors grew in a progressive manner.

In addition, IFN-gamma-insensitive mice developed tumors more rapidly than wild-type mice when bred onto a background deficient in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. IFN-gamma-insensitive p53(-/-) mice also developed a broader spectrum of tumors compared with mice lacking p53 alone. Using tumor cells derived from methylcholanthrene-treated IFN-gamma-insensitive mice, we found IFN-gamma's actions to be mediated at least partly through its direct effects on the tumor cell leading to enhanced tumor cell immunogenicity.

Pfp and IFN-gamma-deficient mice were as susceptible as mice depleted of natural killer (NK) cells in both tumor metastasis models, and IFN-gamma appeared to play an early role in protection from metastasis. Previous experiments in a model of fibrosarcoma induced by the chemical carcinogen methylcholanthrene indicated an important role for NK1.1(+) T cells.

Further analysis demonstrated that IFN-gamma, but not pfp, controlled the growth rate of sarcomas arising in these mice.

	abstract = {After a century of controversy, the notion that the immune system regulates cancer development is experiencing a new resurgence. An overwhelming amount of data from animal models--together with compelling data from human patients--indicate that a functional cancer immunosurveillance process indeed exists that acts as an extrinsic tumor suppressor. However, it has also become clear that the immune system can facilitate tumor progression, at least in part, by sculpting the immunogenic phenotype of tumors as they develop. The recognition that immunity plays a dual role in the complex interactions between tumors and the host prompted a refinement of the cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis into one termed "cancer immunoediting." In this review, we summarize the history of the cancer immunosurveillance controversy and discuss its resolution and evolution into the three Es of cancer immunoediting--elimination, equilibrium, and escape.},

Such obstacles include the ability of tumors to foster a tolerant microenvironment and the activation of a plethora of immunosuppressive mechanisms, which may act in concert to counteract effective immune responses. Here we discuss different strategies employed by tumors to thwart immune responses, including tumor-induced impairment of antigen presentation, the activation of negative costimulatory signals, and the elaboration of immunosuppressive factors. In addition, we underscore the influence of regulatory cell populations that may contribute to this immunosuppressive network; these include regulatory T cells, natural killer T cells, and distinct subsets of immature and mature dendritic cells. The current wealth of preclinical information promises a future scenario in which the synchronized blockade of immunosuppressive mechanisms may be effective in combination with other conventional strategies to overcome immunological tolerance and promote tumor regression.},

	abstract = {Cancers express antigens that are targets for specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). However, cancer cells are genetically unstable. Consequently, sub-populations of cancer cells that no longer express the target antigen may escape destruction by CTLs and grow progressively. We show that cytotoxic T cells indirectly eliminate these antigen loss variants (ALVs) in a model system when the parental cancer cells express sufficient antigen to be effectively cross-presented by the tumor stroma. When the parental tumor expressed lower levels of antigen, cytotoxic T cells eradicated the antigen-positive parental cancer cells, but the ALVs escaped, grew and killed the host. By contrast, when the parental tumor expressed higher levels of antigen, cytotoxic T cells eradicated not only the parental cancer cells but also the ALVs. This 'bystander' elimination of ALVs required stromal cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules capable of presenting the antigen, and occurred in tumors showing evidence of stromal destruction. ALVs were apparently eliminated indirectly when tumor-specific CTLs killed stromal cells that were cross-presenting antigen produced by and released from antigen-positive cancer cells. These results highlight the general importance of targeting the tumor stroma to prevent the escape of variant cancer cells.},

Nonetheless, translation of these successes to solid tumors was found difficult. One major mechanism through which solid tumors can avoid anti-tumor immunity is the downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), which causes reduced recognition by- and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T-cells. Downregulation of MHC-I has been described in 40-90\% of human tumors, often correlating with worse prognosis. Epigenetic and (post-)transcriptional dysregulations relevant in the stabilization of NFkB, IRFs, and NLRC5 are often responsible for MHC-I downregulation in cancer. The intrinsic reversible nature of these dysregulations provides an opportunity to restore MHC-I expression and facilitate adaptive anti-tumor immunity. In this review, we provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying reversible MHC-I downregulation and describe potential strategies to counteract this reduction in MHC-I antigen presentation in cancer.},

In contrast, we show that in mice, a shed form of MULT1, a high-affinity NKG2D ligand, causes NK cell activation and tumor rejection. Recombinant soluble MULT1 stimulated tumor rejection in mice. Soluble MULT1 functions, at least in part, by competitively reversing a global desensitization of NK cells imposed by engagement of membrane NKG2D ligands on tumor-associated cells, such as myeloid cells.

Cancers, by virtue of their local manifestations of tissue dysfunction and destruction, inflammation, and genomic instability, can evoke these protective mechanisms, which support the progression of tumors and prevent their immune eradication. Central to these processes is a subset of CD4+ T cells, known as regulatory T (Treg) cells, that express the X chromosome–linked transcription factor FOXP3. In addition to their critical role in controlling autoimmunity and suppressing inflammatory responses in diverse biological settings, Treg cells are ubiquitously present in the tumor microenvironment where they promote tumor development and progression by dampening antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, Treg cells can directly support the survival of transformed cells through the elaboration of growth factors and interacting with accessory cells in tumors such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Current insights into the biology of tumor-associated Treg cells have opened up opportunities for their selective targeting in cancer, with the goal of alleviating their suppression of antitumor immune responses while maintaining overall immune homeostasis.},

This results in a reprogramming of the surrounding cells, enabling them to play a determinative role in tumor survival and progression. Immune cells are important constituents of the tumor stroma and critically take part in this process. Growing evidence suggests that the innate immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and natural killer cells) as well as adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells) contribute to tumor progression when present in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cross-talk between cancer cells and the proximal immune cells ultimately results in an environment that fosters tumor growth and metastasis. Understanding the nature of this dialog will allow for improved therapeutics that simultaneously target multiple components of the TME, increasing the likelihood of favorable patient outcomes.},

The disorganized tumour vasculature prevents an efficient wash-out of H+ ions released into the extracellular medium but also favours the development of tumour hypoxic regions associated with a shift towards glycolytic metabolism. Under hypoxia, the final balance of glycolysis, including breakdown of generated ATP, is the production of lactate and a stoichiometric amount of H+ ions. Another major source of H+ ions results from hydration of CO2 produced in the more oxidative tumour areas. All of these events occur at high rates in tumours to fulfil bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs. This Review summarizes the current understanding of how H+-generating metabolic processes segregate within tumours according to the distance from blood vessels and inversely how ambient acidosis influences tumour metabolism, reducing glycolysis while promoting mitochondrial activity. The Review also presents novel insights supporting the participation of acidosis in cancer progression via stimulation of autophagy and immunosuppression.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several mechanisms are present in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to impair cytotoxic T cell responses potentially able to control tumor growth. Among these, the accumulation of adenosine (Ado) contributes to tumor progression and represents a promising immunotherapeutic target. Ado has been shown to impair T cell effector function, but the role and mechanisms employed by Ado/Ado receptors (AdoRs) in modulating human peripheral and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) function are still puzzling.
METHODS: CD8+ T cell cytokine production following stimulation was quantified by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. The cytotoxic capacity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was quantified by the chromium release assay following co-culture with autologous or anti-CD3-loaded tumor cell lines. The CD8+ T cell metabolic fitness was evaluated by the seahorse assay and by the quantification of 2-NBDG uptake and CD71/CD98 upregulation upon stimulation. The expression of AdoRs was assessed by RNA flow cytometry, a recently developed technology that we validated by semiquantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), while the impact on T cell function was evaluated by the use of selective antagonists and agonists. The influence of Ado/AdoR on the PKA and mTOR pathways was evaluated by phosphoflow staining of p-CREB and p-S6, respectively, and validated by western blot.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that Ado signaling through the A2A receptor (A2AR) in human peripheral CD8+ T cells and TILs is responsible for the higher sensitivity to Ado-mediated suppression of T central memory cells. We confirmed that Ado is able to impair peripheral and tumor-expanded T cell effector functions, and we show for the first time its impact on metabolic fitness. The Ado-mediated immunosuppressive effects are mediated by increased PKA activation that results in impairment of the mTORC1 pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings unveil A2AR/PKA/mTORC1 as the main Ado signaling pathway impairing the immune competence of peripheral T cells and TILs. Thus, p-CREB and p-S6 may represent useful pharmacodynamic and efficacy biomarkers of immunotherapies targeting Ado. The effect of Ado on T cell metabolic fitness reinforces the importance of the adenosinergic pathway as a target for next-generation immunotherapy.},

It has recently become apparent that CTLA-4, a second counterreceptor for the B7 family of costimulatory molecules, is a negative regulator of T cell activation. Here, in vivo administration of antibodies to CTLA-4 resulted in the rejection of tumors, including preestablished tumors. Furthermore, this rejection resulted in immunity to a secondary exposure to tumor cells. These results suggest that blockade of the inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 can allow for, and potentiate, effective immune responses against tumor cells.},

Mice deficient in PD-1 exhibit a breakdown of peripheral tolerance and demonstrate multiple autoimmune features. We report here that the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) is a member of the B7 gene family. Engagement of PD-1 by PD-L1 leads to the inhibition of T cell receptor-mediated lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion. In addition, PD-1 signaling can inhibit at least suboptimal levels of CD28-mediated costimulation. PD-L1 is expressed by antigen-presenting cells, including human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with interferon gamma, and activated human and murine dendritic cells. In addition, PD-L1 is expressed in nonlymphoid tissues such as heart and lung. The relative levels of inhibitory PD-L1 and costimulatory B7-1/B7-2 signals on antigen-presenting cells may determine the extent of T cell activation and consequently the threshold between tolerance and autoimmunity. PD-L1 expression on nonlymphoid tissues and its potential interaction with PD-1 may subsequently determine the extent of immune responses at sites of inflammation.},

Despite some ICIs have manifested compelling clinical effectiveness in certain tumor types, the majority of patients still showed de novo or adaptive resistance. At present, the overall efficiency of immune checkpoint therapy remains unsatisfactory. Exploring additional immune checkpoint molecules is a hot research topic. Recent studies have identified several new immune checkpoint targets, like lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), and so on. The investigations about these molecules have generated promising results in preclinical studies and/or clinical trials.

To restore the functioning of the immune system and make the patient's immune cells able to recognize and destroy tumors, monoclonal antibodies are broadly used in cancer immunotherapy to block the suppressive or to stimulate the positive immune checkpoints. In this review, we aim to present the current state of application of monoclonal antibodies in clinics, used either as single agents or in a combined treatment. We discuss the limitations of these therapies and possible problem-solving with combined treatment approaches involving both non-biological and biological agents.

In cancer, immune checkpoint pathways are often activated to inhibit the nascent anti-tumor immune response. Immune checkpoint therapies act by blocking or stimulating these pathways and enhance the body's immunological activity against tumors. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death ligand-1(PD-L1) are the most widely studied and recognized inhibitory checkpoint pathways. Drugs blocking these pathways are currently utilized for a wide variety of malignancies and have demonstrated durable clinical activities in a subset of cancer patients. This approach is rapidly extending beyond CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. New inhibitory pathways are under investigation, and drugs blocking LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA, or B7/H3 are being investigated. Furthermore, agonists of stimulatory checkpoint pathways such as OX40, ICOS, GITR, 4-1BB, CD40, or molecules targeting tumor microenvironment components like IDO or TLR are under investigation.

	abstract = {Background
Anti-PD1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) increase overall survival compared to standard of care (SOC) in different tumors. However, a proportion of patients (pts) will have progressive disease (PD) as best response. We conducted a meta-analysis to study the rates of response comparing these antibodies with SOC.

Methods
A search of published trials in MEDLINE and EMBASE analyzing anti-PD1/PD-L1mAbs monotherapy compared to SOC. Relative risk (RR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) of response rates between groups was estimated. Subgroup analyses for location of primary tumor, number of previous treatment lines, selected population by PD-L1 expression and type of radiological assessment were made.

Results
Twelve studies accounting for 6,700 pts were included (anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs: 3,451 pts; SOC: 3,249 pts [2,823 pts: chemotherapy, 426 pts: targeted therapy]). Adjusted response rates were (N, \%): Complete Response (CR) (69/3153, 2.19\%), Partial Response (PR) (596/3153, 18.90\%), Stable Disease (SD) (632/2463, 25.66\%) and PD (1027/2463, 41.70\%); and CR (16/2955, 0.54\%), PR (263/2955, 8.90\%), SD (835/2269, 36.80\%) and PD (834/2269, 36.76\%) with anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs and SOC, respectively. Anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs improved CR rate (RR 3.48) and PR rate (RR 2.27). There were no differences in the PD rate between groups (RR 1.10). Subgroup analyses showed an improvement in clinical benefit with anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs for melanoma (RR 1.59; 1.37–1.84 95\% CI) and those treated in the first line setting (RR 1.57; 1.27–1.95 95\% CI).

Conclusions
Anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs increase overall response rate compared to SOC without an increase in PD rate. Melanoma and pts treated in first line setting seem to have greater benefit with anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs.

Findings
In this systematic meta-analysis, anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs were associated with a greater overall response rate. Patients with melanoma and those managed in the first line setting seem to have an additional benefit with anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs.},

However, many patients either do not respond or do not have durable clinical benefit. Thus, there is great interest in developing predictors of response to immunotherapy and rational combination therapies that can enhance efficacy by overcoming primary and acquired resistance. In this Review, we provide an assessment of immunotherapy response biomarkers that can identify patients who will benefit from monotherapy rather than from combinations. We review the rationale for combination therapy and different strategies, including combinations with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, intratumoural therapies, other immunomodulators, and adaptive cell therapy, including chimeric antigen T-cell receptors and other novel T-cell receptor-based therapies. There are many combination partners in development; therefore, a programmatic approach is needed to develop a framework for biomarker-driven combination therapy selection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this Review, we discuss recent work demonstrating that immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy is affected by a combination of factors involving tumour genomics, host germline genetics, PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) levels and other features of the tumour microenvironment, as well as the gut microbiome. We focus on recently identified molecular and cellular determinants of response.

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has significant clinical activity in diverse cancer classes and can induce durable remissions in even refractory advanced disease. However, only a minority of cancer patients treated with ICB have long-term benefits, and ICB treatment is associated with significant, potentially life-threatening, autoimmune side effects. There is a great need to develop biomarkers of response to guide patient selection to maximize the chance of benefit and prevent unnecessary toxicity, and current biomarkers do not have optimal positive or negative predictive value. A variety of potential biomarkers are currently being developed, including those based on assessment of checkpoint protein expression, evaluation of tumor-intrinsic features including mutation burden and viral infection, evaluation of features of the tumor immune microenvironment including nature of immune cell infiltration, and features of the host such as composition of the gut microbiome. Better understanding of the underlying fundamental mechanisms of immune response and resistance to ICB, along with the use of complementary assays that interrogate distinct features of the tumor, the tumor microenvironment, and host immune system, will allow more precise use of these therapies to optimize patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy improves overall and progression-free survival in patients with untreated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50\% or greater. We investigated overall survival after treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1\% or greater.
METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without a sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, life expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1\% or greater. Randomisation was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (≥50\% vs 1-49\%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with a TPS of 50\% or greater, 20\% or greater, and 1\% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0·0122, p=0·0120, and p=0·0124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the previous findings were significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894.
FINDINGS: From Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1\% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47\%) had a TPS of 50\% or greater and 818 patients (64\%) had a TPS of 20\% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12·8 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (≥50\% hazard ratio 0·69, 95\% CI 0·56-0·85, p=0·0003; ≥20\% 0·77, 0·64-0·92, p=0·0020, and ≥1\% 0·81, 0·71-0·93, p=0·0018). The median surival values by TPS population were 20·0 months (95\% CI 15·4-24·9) for pembrolizumab versus 12·2 months (10·4-14·2) for chemotherapy, 17·7 months (15·3-22·1) versus 13·0 months (11·6-15·3), and 16·7 months (13·9-19·7) versus 12·1 months (11·3-13·3), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18\%) of 636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41\%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death in 13 (2\%) and 14 (2\%) patients, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: The benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.

Among all patients, higher somatic TMB (highest 20\% in each histology) was associated with better overall survival. For most cancer histologies, an association between higher TMB and improved survival was observed. The TMB cutpoints associated with improved survival varied markedly between cancer types. These data indicate that TMB is associated with improved survival in patients receiving ICI across a wide variety of cancer types, but that there may not be one universal definition of high TMB.},

We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53\% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21\% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor.

	abstract = {Combination anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy promotes antitumor immunity and provides superior benefit to patients with advanced-stage melanoma compared with either therapy alone. T cell immunity requires recognition of antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II proteins by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. We examined MHC class I and class II protein expression on tumor cells from previously untreated melanoma patients and correlated the results with transcriptional and genomic analyses and with clinical response to anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or combination therapy. Most ({\textgreater}50\% of cells) or complete loss of melanoma MHC class I membrane expression was observed in 78 of 181 cases (43\%), was associated with transcriptional repression of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and B2M, and predicted primary resistance to anti-CTLA-4, but not anti-PD-1, therapy. Melanoma MHC class II membrane expression on {\textgreater}1\% cells was observed in 55 of 181 cases (30\%), was associated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IFN-γ-mediated gene signatures, and predicted response to anti-PD-1, but not anti-CTLA-4, therapy. We conclude that primary response to anti-CTLA-4 requires robust melanoma MHC class I expression. In contrast, primary response to anti-PD-1 is associated with preexisting IFN-γ-mediated immune activation that includes tumor-specific MHC class II expression and components of innate immunity when MHC class I is compromised. The benefits of combined checkpoint blockade may be attributable, in part, to distinct requirements for melanoma-specific antigen presentation to initiate antitumor immunity.},

	abstract = {The immune composition of the tumor microenvironment regulates processes including angiogenesis, metastasis, and the response to drugs or immunotherapy. To facilitate the characterization of the immune component of tumors from transcriptomics data, a number of immune cell transcriptome signatures have been reported that are made up of lists of marker genes indicative of the presence a given immune cell population. The majority of these gene signatures have been defined through analysis of isolated blood cells. However, blood cells do not reflect the differentiation or activation state of similar cells within tissues, including tumors, and consequently markers derived from blood cells do not necessarily transfer well to tissues. To address this issue, we generated a set of immune gene signatures derived directly from tissue transcriptomics data using a network-based deconvolution approach. We define markers for seven immune cell types, collectively named ImSig, and demonstrate how these markers can be used for the quantitative estimation of the immune cell content of tumor and nontumor tissue samples. The utility of ImSig is demonstrated through the stratification of melanoma patients into subgroups of prognostic significance and the identification of immune cells with the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data derived from tumors. Use of ImSig is facilitated by an R package (imsig). Cancer Immunol Res; 6(11); 1388-400. ©2018 AACR.},

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2018.78.2276},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Biomarkers that can predict response to anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy across multiple tumor types include a T-cell-inflamed gene-expression profile (GEP), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Associations between these biomarkers and the clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a clinical trial that encompassed 20 cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors.
METHODS: KEYNOTE-028 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054806) is a nonrandomized, phase Ib trial that enrolled 475 patients with PD-L1-positive advanced solid tumors who were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 2 years or until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; by RECIST v1.1, investigator review). Secondary end points included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Relationships between T-cell-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB and antitumor activity were exploratory end points.
RESULTS: ORRs (with 95\% CIs) ranged from 0\% (0.0\% to 14.2\%) in pancreatic cancer to 33\% (15.6\% to 55.3\%) in small-cell lung cancer. Across cohorts, median (95\% CI) PFS ranged from 1.7 months (1.5 to 2.9 months) to 6.8 months (1.9 to 14.1 months) in pancreatic and thyroid cancers, respectively, and median OS from 3.9 months (2.8 to 5.5 months) to 21.1 months (9.1 to 22.4 months) in vulvar and carcinoid tumors, respectively. Higher response rates and longer PFS were demonstrated in tumors with higher T-cell-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and/or TMB. Correlations of TMB with GEP and PD-L1 were low. Response patterns indicate that patients with tumors that had high levels of both TMB and inflammatory markers (GEP or PD-L1) represent a population with the highest likelihood of response. Safety was similar and consistent with prior pembrolizumab reports.
CONCLUSION: A T-cell--inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB predicted response to pembrolizumab in multiple tumor types. These biomarkers (alone/in combination) may help identify patients who have a higher likelihood of response to anti-PD-1 therapies across a broad spectrum of cancers.},

	abstract = {Most patients with advanced cancer eventually acquire resistance to targeted therapies, spurring extensive efforts to identify molecular events mediating therapy resistance. Many of these events involve synthetic rescue (SR) interactions, where the reduction in cancer cell viability caused by targeted gene inactivation is rescued by an adaptive alteration of another gene (the rescuer). Here, we perform a genome-wide in silico prediction of SR rescuer genes by analyzing tumor transcriptomics and survival data of 10,000 TCGA cancer patients. Predicted SR interactions are validated in new experimental screens. We show that SR interactions can successfully predict cancer patients' response and emerging resistance. Inhibiting predicted rescuer genes sensitizes resistant cancer cells to therapies synergistically, providing initial leads for developing combinatorial approaches to overcome resistance proactively. Finally, we show that the SR analysis of melanoma patients successfully identifies known mediators of resistance to immunotherapy and predicts novel rescuers.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy provides remarkable clinical gains and has been very successful in treatment of melanoma. However, only a subset of patients with advanced tumors currently benefit from ICB therapies, which at times incur considerable side effects and costs. Constructing predictors of patient response has remained a serious challenge because of the complexity of the immune response and the shortage of large cohorts of ICB-treated patients that include both 'omics' and response data. Here we build immuno-predictive score (IMPRES), a predictor of ICB response in melanoma which encompasses 15 pairwise transcriptomics relations between immune checkpoint genes. It is based on two key conjectures: (i) immune mechanisms underlying spontaneous regression in neuroblastoma can predict melanoma response to ICB, and (ii) key immune interactions can be captured via specific pairwise relations of the expression of immune checkpoint genes. IMPRES is validated on nine published datasets1-6 and on a newly generated dataset with 31 patients treated with anti-PD-1 and 10 with anti-CTLA-4, spanning 297 samples in total. It achieves an overall accuracy of AUC = 0.83, outperforming existing predictors and capturing almost all true responders while misclassifying less than half of the nonresponders. Future studies are warranted to determine the value of the approach presented here in other cancer types.},

One possible modulator could be the intestinal microbiota. We compared melanoma growth in mice harboring distinct commensal microbiota and observed differences in spontaneous antitumor immunity, which were eliminated upon cohousing or after fecal transfer. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA identified Bifidobacterium as associated with the antitumor effects. Oral administration of Bifidobacterium alone improved tumor control to the same degree as programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)-specific antibody therapy (checkpoint blockade), and combination treatment nearly abolished tumor outgrowth. Augmented dendritic cell function leading to enhanced CD8(+) T cell priming and accumulation in the tumor microenvironment mediated the effect.

Only those patients able to achieve a second remission with no minimal residual disease (MRD) have a hope for long-term survival in the context of a subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We have treated five relapsed B-ALL subjects with autologous T cells expressing a CD19-specific CD28/CD3ζ second-generation dual-signaling chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) termed 19-28z. All patients with persistent morphological disease or MRD+ disease upon T cell infusion demonstrated rapid tumor eradication and achieved MRD− complete remissions as assessed by deep sequencing polymerase chain reaction. Therapy was well tolerated, although significant cytokine elevations, specifically observed in those patients with morphologic evidence of disease at the time of treatment, required lymphotoxic steroid therapy to ameliorate cytokine-mediated toxicities. Indeed, cytokine elevations directly correlated to tumor burden at the time of CAR-modified T cell infusions. Tumor cells from one patient with relapsed disease after CAR-modified T cell therapy, who was ineligible for additional allo-HSCT or T cell therapy, exhibited persistent expression of CD19 and sensitivity to autologous 19-28z T cell–mediated cytotoxicity, which suggests potential clinical benefit of additional CAR-modified T cell infusions. These results demonstrate the marked antitumor efficacy of 19-28z CAR-modified T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL and the reliability of this therapy to induce profound molecular remissions, forming a highly effective bridge to potentially curative therapy with subsequent allo-HSCT.
Five adults with chemotherapy-refractory B-ALL were induced into molecular remissions after treatment with CD19 CAR-targeted T cells.

It remains to be established whether chimeric antigen receptor T cells have clinical activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Two children with relapsed and refractory pre-B-cell ALL received infusions of T cells transduced with anti-CD19 antibody and a T-cell signaling molecule (CTL019 chimeric antigen receptor T cells), at a dose of 1.4×10(6) to 1.2×10(7) CTL019 cells per kilogram of body weight. In both patients, CTL019 T cells expanded to a level that was more than 1000 times as high as the initial engraftment level, and the cells were identified in bone marrow. In addition, the chimeric antigen receptor T cells were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where they persisted at high levels for at least 6 months. Eight grade 3 or 4 adverse events were noted. The cytokine-release syndrome and B-cell aplasia developed in both patients. In one child, the cytokine-release syndrome was severe; cytokine blockade with etanercept and tocilizumab was effective in reversing the syndrome and did not prevent expansion of chimeric antigen receptor T cells or reduce antileukemic efficacy. Complete remission was observed in both patients and is ongoing in one patient at 11 months after treatment. The other patient had a relapse, with blast cells that no longer expressed CD19, approximately 2 months after treatment. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells are capable of killing even aggressive, treatment-refractory acute leukemia cells in vivo. The emergence of tumor cells that no longer express the target indicates a need to target other molecules in addition to CD19 in some patients with ALL.},

T cells with engineered CARs acquire potent immunological properties and redirect the immune system in order to eliminate malignant cells. First-engineered T cells with chimeric molecule (CAR-T cells) were developed in 1989–1993 by Israeli immunologists Zelig Eshhar and Gideon Gross. The first clinical application of CAR-T cells was done in the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia by the immunologist Carl June and hematologist David Porter to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2011 and together with the pediatrician Stephan Grupp to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 2012. The US Food and Drug Administration Agency (FDA) in 2017 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 have licensed two products of CAR-T cells: tisagenlecleucel for the use in children and young adults up to 25 years of age with B-cell ALL who do not respond to treatment or have relapsed two or more times and tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel for the use in adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Current progress in CAR technology includes the use in other hematological malignancies, solid tumors, the use of dual CAR-T cells and chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cells (CAR-NK cells).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Objective regression of the cancer was observed in 9 of 15 patients (60 percent) who had not previously been treated with interleukin-2 and in 2 of 5 patients (40 percent) in whom previous therapy with interleukin-2 had failed. Regression of cancer occurred in the lungs, liver, bone, skin, and subcutaneous sites and lasted from 2 to more than 13 months. Toxic effects of interleukin-2 occurred, although the treatment course was short (five days); these side effects were reversible. It appears that in patients with metastatic melanoma, this experimental treatment regimen can produce higher response rates than those achieved with interleukin-2 administered alone or with lymphokine-activated killer cells.

Unlike traditional chemo- and radiotherapy, immunotherapy actives host immune system to attack malignancies, and this potentially offers long-term protection from recurrence with less toxicity in comparison to conventional chemo- and radiation therapy. In adoptive CD8+ T cell therapy (ACT), large numbers of tumor-specific T cells are sourced from patients and expanded in vitro and infused back to patients. T cells can be expanded from naturally-induced tumor-specific CD8+ T cells isolated from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or genetically-modified autologous circulating CD8+ T cells. The engineered T cells expressed tumor-specific antigen receptors including chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and T cell receptors (TCRs), prepared from cultured B and T cell clones, respectively. The most successful ACT, anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy directed against B cell lymphoma, is already approved for use based on evidence of efficacy. Efficacy of solid tumors is not yet forthcoming. This review summarizes current technology developments using ACT in clinical trials. In this review, differences between various ACT approaches are discussed. Furthermore, resistance factors in the tumor microenvironment are also considered, as are immune related adverse effects, critical clinic monitoring parameters and potential mitigation approaches.},

We used synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to overcome immunological tolerance and mediate tumor rejection in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Remission was induced in a subset of subjects, but most did not respond. Comprehensive assessment of patient-derived CAR T cells to identify mechanisms of therapeutic success and failure has not been explored. We performed genomic, phenotypic and functional evaluations to identify determinants of response. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that CAR T cells from complete-responding patients with CLL were enriched in memory-related genes, including IL-6/STAT3 signatures, whereas T cells from nonresponders upregulated programs involved in effector differentiation, glycolysis, exhaustion and apoptosis. Sustained remission was associated with an elevated frequency of CD27+CD45RO-CD8+ T cells before CAR T cell generation, and these lymphocytes possessed memory-like characteristics. Highly functional CAR T cells from patients produced STAT3-related cytokines, and serum IL-6 correlated with CAR T cell expansion. IL-6/STAT3 blockade diminished CAR T cell proliferation. Furthermore, a mechanistically relevant population of CD27+PD-1-CD8+ CAR T cells expressing high levels of the IL-6 receptor predicts therapeutic response and is responsible for tumor control. These findings uncover new features of CAR T cell biology and underscore the potential of using pretreatment biomarkers of response to advance immunotherapies.},

	abstract = {Immunometabolism has emerged as a major mechanism central to adaptive and innate immune regulation. From early observations that inflammatory cytokines were induced in obese adipose tissue and that these cytokines contributed to metabolic disease, it was clear that metabolism and the immunological state are inextricably linked. With a second research wave arising from studies in cancer metabolism to also study the intrinsic metabolic pathways of immune cells themselves and how those pathways influence cell fate and function, immunometabolism is a rapidly maturing area of research. Several key themes and goals drive the field. There is abundant evidence that metabolic pathways are closely tied to cell signaling and differentiation which leads different subsets of immune cells to adopt unique metabolic programs specific to their state and environment. In this way, metabolic signaling drives cell fate. It is also apparent that microenvironment greatly influences cell metabolism. Immune cells adopt programs specific for the tissues where they infiltrate and reside. Ultimately, a central goal of the field is to apply immunometabolism findings to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies in a wide range of diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and metabolic syndrome. This review summarizes these facets of immunometabolism and highlights opportunities for clinical translation.},

Abrogation of quiescence predisposed Tsc1-deficient T cells to apoptosis that resulted in loss of conventional T cells and invariant natural killer T cells. Loss of Tsc1 function dampened in vivo immune responses to bacterial infection. Tsc1-deficient T cells had more activity of the serine-threonine kinase complex mTORC1 but less mTORC2 activity, and activation of mTORC1 was essential for the disruption of immune homeostasis. Therefore, Tsc1-dependent control of mTOR is crucial in actively maintaining the quiescence of naive T cells to facilitate adaptive immune function.},

	abstract = {Adenosine produced as a byproduct of metabolic activity is present in all tissues and produces dose-dependent suppression of TCR signaling. Naive T cell maintenance depends on inhibition of TCR signals by environmental sensors, which are yet to be fully defined. We produced mice with a floxed adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) gene, Adora2a, and show that either global A2AR deletion or cre-mediated T cell deletion elicits a decline in the number of naive but not memory T cells. A2AR signaling maintains naive T cells in a quiescent state by inhibiting TCR-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, thereby reducing IL-7Rα down-regulation and naive T cell apoptosis. Patterns of IL-7Rα expression on T cells in chimeric mice reconstituted with Adora2a(+/+) and Adora2a(-/-) bone marrow cells suggest that decreased IL-7Rα in naive T cells is a cell-intrinsic consequence of Adora2a deletion. In addition, A2AR expression increases in early thymic T cell development and contributes to progression of double-negative thymic precursors to single-positive thymocytes with increased IL-7Rα expression. Therefore, A2AR signaling regulates T cell development and maintenance to sustain normal numbers of naive T cells in the periphery.},

Furthermore, we used mice with reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production in T cells (T-Uqcrfs(-/-) mice) to show that mitochondria are required for T cell activation to produce mROS for activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and subsequent IL-2 induction. These mice could not induce antigen-specific expansion of T cells in vivo, but Uqcrfs1(-/-) T cells retained the ability to proliferate in vivo under lymphopenic conditions. This suggests that Uqcrfs1(-/-) T cells were not lacking bioenergetically but rather lacked specific ROS-dependent signaling events needed for antigen-specific expansion. Thus, mitochondrial metabolism is a critical component of T cell activation through the production of complex III ROS.},

Conditional gene targeting of the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclc) blocked GSH production specifically in murine T cells. Gclc-deficient T cells initially underwent normal activation but could not meet their increased energy and biosynthetic requirements. GSH deficiency compromised the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin-1 (mTOR) and expression of NFAT and Myc transcription factors, abrogating the energy utilization and Myc-dependent metabolic reprogramming that allows activated T cells to switch to glycolysis and glutaminolysis. In vivo, T-cell-specific ablation of murine Gclc prevented autoimmune disease but blocked antiviral defense.

	abstract = {Fatty acids (FAs) are essential constituents of cell membranes, signaling molecules, and bioenergetic substrates. Because CD8(+) T cells undergo both functional and metabolic changes during activation and differentiation, dynamic changes in FA metabolism also occur. However, the contributions of de novo lipogenesis to acquisition and maintenance of CD8(+) T cell function are unclear. In this article, we demonstrate the role of FA synthesis in CD8(+) T cell immunity. T cell-specific deletion of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase 1 (ACC1), an enzyme that catalyzes conversion of acetyl coenzyme A to malonyl coenzyme A, a carbon donor for long-chain FA synthesis, resulted in impaired peripheral persistence and homeostatic proliferation of CD8(+) T cells in naive mice. Loss of ACC1 did not compromise effector CD8(+) T cell differentiation upon listeria infection but did result in a severe defect in Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell accumulation because of increased death of proliferating cells. Furthermore, in vitro mitogenic stimulation demonstrated that defective blasting and survival of ACC1-deficient CD8(+) T cells could be rescued by provision of exogenous FA. These results suggest an essential role for ACC1-mediated de novo lipogenesis as a regulator of CD8(+) T cell expansion, and may provide insights for therapeutic targets for interventions in autoimmune diseases, cancer, and chronic infections.},

To exit quiescence, T cells rely on environmental nutrients, including glucose and the amino acids glutamine, leucine, serine, and arginine. The expression of transporters for these nutrients is tightly regulated and required for T cell activation. In contrast to these amino acids, which are essential or require multi-step biosynthesis, alanine can be made from pyruvate by a single transamination. Here, we show that extracellular alanine is nevertheless required for efficient exit from quiescence during naive T cell activation and memory T cell restimulation. Alanine deprivation leads to metabolic and functional impairments. Mechanistically, this vulnerability reflects the low expression of alanine aminotransferase, the enzyme required for interconverting pyruvate and alanine, whereas activated T cells instead induce alanine transporters. Stable isotope tracing reveals that alanine is not catabolized but instead supports protein synthesis. Thus, T cells depend on exogenous alanine for protein synthesis and normal activation.},

Warburg and co-workers showed in the 1920s that, under aerobic conditions, tumour tissues metabolize approximately tenfold more glucose to lactate in a given time than normal tissues, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. However, this increase in aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells is often erroneously thought to occur instead of mitochondrial respiration and has been misinterpreted as evidence for damage to respiration instead of damage to the regulation of glycolysis. In fact, many cancers exhibit the Warburg effect while retaining mitochondrial respiration. We re-examine Warburg's observations in relation to the current concepts of cancer metabolism as being intimately linked to alterations of mitochondrial DNA, oncogenes and tumour suppressors, and thus readily exploitable for cancer therapy.},

We show that enhancing glycolysis in an antigenic "regressor" tumor is sufficient to override the protective ability of T cells to control tumor growth. We also show that checkpoint blockade antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, which are used clinically, restore glucose in tumor microenvironment, permitting T cell glycolysis and IFN-γ production. Furthermore, we found that blocking PD-L1 directly on tumors dampens glycolysis by inhibiting mTOR activity and decreasing expression of glycolysis enzymes, reflecting a role for PD-L1 in tumor glucose utilization.

PD-1 promotes FAO of endogenous lipids by increasing expression of CPT1A, and inducing lipolysis as indicated by elevation of the lipase ATGL, the lipolysis marker glycerol and release of fatty acids. Conversely, CTLA-4 inhibits glycolysis without augmenting FAO, suggesting that CTLA-4 sustains the metabolic profile of non-activated cells. Because T cells utilize glycolysis during differentiation to effectors, our findings reveal a metabolic mechanism responsible for PD-1-mediated blockade of T-effector cell differentiation.

Therefore, we questioned whether mitochondrial dynamics controls T cell metabolism. We show that TE cells have punctate mitochondria, while TM cells maintain fused networks. The fusion protein Opa1 is required for TM, but not TE cells after infection, and enforcing fusion in TE cells imposes TM cell characteristics and enhances antitumor function. Our data suggest that, by altering cristae morphology, fusion in TM cells configures electron transport chain (ETC) complex associations favoring oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and FAO, while fission in TE cells leads to cristae expansion, reducing ETC efficiency and promoting aerobic glycolysis.

We found that Gln restriction during human T cell activation favored CD4 T cells with high expression of the Treg transcription factor FOXP3. This resulted from shrinking numbers and reduced proliferation of activated FOXP3(lo/-)CD4 T cells while FOXP3(hi)CD4 T cell numbers increased. This gain was abolished by blocking Gln synthetase, an enzyme that responds to Gln and purine/pyrimidine deficiencies. The shift toward FOXP3(hi)CD4 T cells under Gln restriction was recapitulated with inhibitors of Gln-dependent pyrimidine and purine syntheses that together closely mimicked declining cell numbers and cell cycles, and by small interfering RNA knockdown of the respective rate-limiting Gln-consuming enzymes CAD and PPAT. FOXP3(hi)-enriched CD25(hi)CD4 T cells from these cultures inhibited proliferation, but they also produced effector cytokines, including IL-17A. The latter was largely confined to CTLA-4(hi)-expressing FOXP3(hi)-enriched CD25(hi)CD4 T cells that suppressed proliferation more weakly than did CTLA-4(lo/-)CD25(hi)FOXP3(hi)-enriched T cells. A causal link between high IL-17A production and impaired suppression of proliferation could not be demonstrated, however. Collectively, these results reveal a Gln synthetase-dependent increase and resilience of FOXP3(hi) cells under Gln restriction, and they demonstrate that impaired Gln-dependent nucleotide synthesis promotes FOXP3(hi) cells with regulator properties. It remains to be investigated to what extent the concomitant retention of IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells may limit the therapeutic potential of Tregs enriched through targeting these pathways in vivo.},

	abstract = {Sustained glucose and glutamine transport are essential for activated T lymphocytes to support ATP and macromolecule biosynthesis. We found that glutamine and glucose also fuel an indispensable dynamic regulation of intracellular protein O-GlcNAcylation at key stages of T cell development, transformation and differentiation. Glucose and glutamine are precursors of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a substrate for cellular glycosyltransferases. Immune-activated T cells contained higher concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc and increased intracellular protein O-GlcNAcylation controlled by the enzyme O-linked-β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) glycosyltransferase as compared with naive cells. We identified Notch, the T cell antigen receptor and c-Myc as key controllers of T cell protein O-GlcNAcylation via regulation of glucose and glutamine transport. Loss of O-GlcNAc transferase blocked T cell progenitor renewal, malignant transformation and peripheral T cell clonal expansion. Nutrient-dependent signaling pathways regulated by O-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase are thus fundamental for T cell biology.},

	abstract = {Interleukin-17 (IL-17)-secreting T cells of the T helper 17 (TH17) lineage play a pathogenic role in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune conditions and thus represent a highly attractive target for therapeutic intervention. We report that inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) restrains the formation of human and mouse TH17 cells and promotes the development of anti-inflammatory Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. We show that TH17 cells, but not Treg cells, depend on ACC1-mediated de novo fatty acid synthesis and the underlying glycolytic-lipogenic metabolic pathway for their development. Although TH17 cells use this pathway to produce phospholipids for cellular membranes, Treg cells readily take up exogenous fatty acids for this purpose. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition or T cell-specific deletion of ACC1 not only blocks de novo fatty acid synthesis but also interferes with the metabolic flux of glucose-derived carbon via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In vivo, treatment with the ACC-specific inhibitor soraphen A or T cell-specific deletion of ACC1 in mice attenuates TH17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Our results indicate fundamental differences between TH17 cells and Treg cells regarding their dependency on ACC1-mediated de novo fatty acid synthesis, which might be exploited as a new strategy for metabolic immune modulation of TH17 cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.},

Although signaling via the lipid kinase PI(3)K (phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase), the serine-threonine kinase Akt and the metabolic checkpoint kinase complex mTORC1 induces both expression of the glucose transporter Glut1 and aerobic glycolysis for Teff cell proliferation and inflammatory function, the mechanisms that regulate Treg cell metabolism and function remain unclear. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals that promote Treg cell proliferation increased PI(3)K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling, glycolysis and expression of Glut1. However, TLR-induced mTORC1 signaling also impaired Treg cell suppressive capacity. Conversely, the transcription factor Foxp3 opposed PI(3)K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling to diminish glycolysis and anabolic metabolism while increasing oxidative and catabolic metabolism. Notably, Glut1 expression was sufficient to increase the number of Treg cells, but it reduced their suppressive capacity and Foxp3 expression. Thus, inflammatory signals and Foxp3 balance mTORC1 signaling and glucose metabolism to control the proliferation and suppressive function of Treg cells.},

Tissues with low glucose and high lactate concentrations, such as the intestinal tract or ischemic tissues, frequently require immune responses to be more pro-tolerant, avoiding unwanted reactions against self-antigens or commensal bacteria. T-regulatory cells (Tregs) maintain peripheral tolerance, but how Tregs function in low-glucose, lactate-rich environments is unknown. We report that the Treg transcription factor Foxp3 reprograms T cell metabolism by suppressing Myc and glycolysis, enhancing oxidative phosphorylation, and increasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidation. These adaptations allow Tregs a metabolic advantage in low-glucose, lactate-rich environments; they resist lactate-mediated suppression of T cell function and proliferation. This metabolic phenotype may explain how Tregs promote peripheral immune tolerance during tissue injury but also how cancer cells evade immune destruction in the tumor microenvironment. Understanding Treg metabolism may therefore lead to novel approaches for selective immune modulation in cancer and autoimmune diseases.},

	doi = {10.1038/nature12297},
	abstract = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway integrates diverse environmental inputs, including immune signals and metabolic cues, to direct T-cell fate decisions. The activation of mTOR, which is the catalytic subunit of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, delivers an obligatory signal for the proper activation and differentiation of effector CD4(+) T cells, whereas in the regulatory T-cell (T(reg)) compartment, the Akt-mTOR axis is widely acknowledged as a crucial negative regulator of T(reg)-cell de novo differentiation and population expansion. However, whether mTOR signalling affects the homeostasis and function of T(reg) cells remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mTORC1 signalling is a pivotal positive determinant of T(reg)-cell function in mice. T(reg) cells have elevated steady-state mTORC1 activity compared to naive T cells. Signals through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) provide major inputs for mTORC1 activation, which in turn programs the suppressive function of T(reg) cells. Disruption of mTORC1 through Treg-specific deletion of the essential component raptor leads to a profound loss of T(reg)-cell suppressive activity in vivo and the development of a fatal early onset inflammatory disorder. Mechanistically, raptor/mTORC1 signalling in T(reg) cells promotes cholesterol and lipid metabolism, with the mevalonate pathway particularly important for coordinating T(reg)-cell proliferation and upregulation of the suppressive molecules CTLA4 and ICOS to establish Treg-cell functional competency. By contrast, mTORC1 does not directly affect the expression of Foxp3 or anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines in T(reg) cells, suggesting a non-conventional mechanism for T(reg)-cell functional regulation. Finally, we provide evidence that mTORC1 maintains T(reg)-cell function partly through inhibiting the mTORC2 pathway. Our results demonstrate that mTORC1 acts as a fundamental 'rheostat' in T(reg) cells to link immunological signals from TCR and IL-2 to lipogenic pathways and functional fitness, and highlight a central role of metabolic programming of T(reg)-cell suppressive activity in immune homeostasis and tolerance.},

	abstract = {Naive CD8+ T cells rely upon oxidation of fatty acids as a primary source of energy. After antigen encounter, T cells shift to a glycolytic metabolism to sustain effector function. It is unclear, however, whether changes in glucose metabolism ultimately influence the ability of activated T cells to become long-lived memory cells. We used a fluorescent glucose analog, 2-NBDG, to quantify glucose uptake in activated CD8+ T cells. We found that cells exhibiting limited glucose incorporation had a molecular profile characteristic of memory precursor cells and an increased capacity to enter the memory pool compared with cells taking up high amounts of glucose. Accordingly, enforcing glycolytic metabolism by overexpressing the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase-1 severely impaired the ability of CD8+ T cells to form long-term memory. Conversely, activation of CD8+ T cells in the presence of an inhibitor of glycolysis, 2-deoxyglucose, enhanced the generation of memory cells and antitumor functionality. Our data indicate that augmenting glycolytic flux drives CD8+ T cells toward a terminally differentiated state, while its inhibition preserves the formation of long-lived memory CD8+ T cells. These results have important implications for improving the efficacy of T cell-based therapies against chronic infectious diseases and cancer.},

	abstract = {CD8 T cells, which have a crucial role in immunity to infection and cancer, are maintained in constant numbers, but on antigen stimulation undergo a developmental program characterized by distinct phases encompassing the expansion and then contraction of antigen-specific effector (T(E)) populations, followed by the persistence of long-lived memory (T(M)) cells. Although this predictable pattern of CD8 T-cell responses is well established, the underlying cellular mechanisms regulating the transition to T(M) cells remain undefined. Here we show that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an adaptor protein in the TNF-receptor and interleukin-1R/Toll-like receptor superfamily, regulates CD8 T(M)-cell development after infection by modulating fatty acid metabolism. We show that mice with a T-cell-specific deletion of TRAF6 mount robust CD8 T(E)-cell responses, but have a profound defect in their ability to generate T(M) cells that is characterized by the disappearance of antigen-specific cells in the weeks after primary immunization. Microarray analyses revealed that TRAF6-deficient CD8 T cells exhibit altered expression of genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism. Consistent with this, activated CD8 T cells lacking TRAF6 display defective AMP-activated kinase activation and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in response to growth factor withdrawal. Administration of the anti-diabetic drug metformin restored FAO and CD8 T(M)-cell generation in the absence of TRAF6. This treatment also increased CD8 T(M) cells in wild-type mice, and consequently was able to considerably improve the efficacy of an experimental anti-cancer vaccine.},
