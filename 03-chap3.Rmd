## Materials and Methods

### Softwares and code

R version 3.6.3 was used for all statistical tests. P values lesser than 2.22e-16 may not be computed accurately and are reported as “P<2.22e-16”. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method was used for P value adjustment. The R packages ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) and ComplexHeatmap (Gu et al. 2016) were used to create the visualizations. Code for the analyses can be found in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ruppinlab/Tcell_Ucp2.
